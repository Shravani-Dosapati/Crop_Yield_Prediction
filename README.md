# Crop Yield Prediction App 🌾

This project is a Machine Learning web application built using **Streamlit**. It predicts the crop yield (in tons per hectare) based on various agricultural and environmental factors.

## 🚀 Overview
Farmers and agriculturalists can use this tool to estimate potential yields by inputting specific conditions, helping in better resource planning and decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Streamlit** (Frontend)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)

## 📊 Features
The model takes the following inputs to generate a prediction:
* **Region:** (North, South, East, West)
* **Soil Type:** (e.g., Clay, Sandy, Loamy)
* **Crop Type:** (Wheat, Rice, Maize, etc.)
* **Environmental Factors:** Rainfall, Temperature, Weather Condition
* **Agricultural Inputs:** Fertilizer Used, Irrigation Used, Days to Harvest
